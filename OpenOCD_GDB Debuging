!!! GDB will connect to your embedded system only with a server daemon (in this case OpenOCD - the port to connect to is 3333)
! This file give a help of using OpenOCD and GDB to debug a code on embeded systems
! OpenOCD is the server that makes the connection between embeded system and the computer interface through GDB client

I. Through linux concole:

1. Open OpenOCD server
# openocd -f interface/your_debug_interface  -f target/your_target_system

! your debug interface = in openOCD scripts (in my case /usr/share/openocd/scripts/..) you will find board/chip/cpld/cpu/fpga/interface/target/, depending of your configuration
                        you have to specify what fit best for you
                        
2. Open GDB client

# arm-none-eabi-gdb path_to/your_elf_file.elf
!you opened gdb client and loaded with the elf file specification

# (gdb) target remote :3333
!connected to the embedded system through OpenOCD

# (gdb) monitor reset
! do a software reset of your embedded system

....

II. Through GUI interface - Visual Studio Code
1. you have to define a launch.json configuration file such as the present example (modified accordingly to your configuration)

2. connect JTAG device to the embeded board and to your computer through USB port
3. start debugging (F5) ... then control your step debugging through the small arrows (somewhere on your display)

... have a nice debugging ...
